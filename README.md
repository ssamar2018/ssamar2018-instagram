# ssamar2018-instagram README

This project is a simple Instagram-mock up based on instructions provided by YouTube video: "Make an instagram like site in under 30 minutes! (Ruby on Rails)", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE. This web app supports login, registration, signout, creating a post of a picture and a description, and viewing all past posts. This project relies on Devise, Bootstrap, and Paperclip as frameworks to provide some of the above functionalities.

* a description of the project (citing the original YouTube tutorial)
